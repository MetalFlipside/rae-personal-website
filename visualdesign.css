/* Hi, this is Rae. I graduated from Peking University in 2024 and have worked as a Growth Operations specialist at an AI startup in Haidian, Beijing, starting as an intern before becoming a full-time employee. I excel at uncovering growth opportunities through data and thrive in the dynamic AI landscape, finding clarity in uncertainty. Most of the time, I’m calm and composed, enjoying the process of breaking down complex tasks, refining them to perfection, and questioning conventional problem-solving methods. Outside work, I’m passionate about photography and music, currently creating my first Indie Rock album. In my free time, I enjoy rock climbing and watching movies. */

/* During my internship at 36Kr, I worked as a content intern focusing on overseas business articles within a startup media team. With significant creative freedom from my supervisor, I independently completed two well-received articles, handling everything from topic planning and desk research to interviews and writing. This experience honed my market research and resource integration skills and sparked a deep interest in global business.  */

/* Curious about big tech, I joined ByteDance as a content operations intern for Toutiao’s encyclopedia business. The role gave me insight into large corporations, with their robust structures, mature workflows, and vast knowledge bases. However, the intern tasks were highly fragmented, requiring strict adherence to SOPs with little room for creativity, even in planning activities. I felt like a cog in a machine, unsure of my impact, which led me to consider leaving the corporate world. */

/* Later, a serendipitous opportunity brought me to RightBrain AI, a startup fresh off its angel round, where I was the only intern in the operations team, reporting directly to the founder. As the team grew with like-minded colleagues, the environment buzzed with energy and creativity. I contributed to the cold launch of a million-user AIGC creation tool, managed social media accounts on X, Instagram, TikTok, and the official Discord community, built my first data dashboard while learning SQL, connected with global users, self-taught Google Ads via YouTube to run my first ad account, wrote PRDs for growth campaigns, and even learned Vibe Coding to create event pages. This rapid growth fueled my passion for AI product growth—nothing excites me more than pushing my boundaries and embracing the possibilities of the unpredictable AI landscape. */
